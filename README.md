# IBM Data Science Capstone – SpaceX Launch Analysis

This repository contains the completed notebooks for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone project.
The project analyzes SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to identify factors associated with first-stage landing success using data collection, exploratory analysis, visualization, geographic mapping, and machine learning.

## Repository Contents

### Data Collection
- SpaceX launch data collected using SpaceX REST APIs.
- Additional launch information gathered through web scraping.

### Data Wrangling
- Cleaning, transformation, and preparation of launch datasets for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization-based analysis exploring payload mass, orbit type, launch site, and mission outcomes.
- SQL-based analysis to identify patterns related to launch success.

### Geographic Analysis
- Interactive maps created using Folium to visualize launch sites and analyze geographic proximity factors.

### Dashboard
- An interactive dashboard built to explore revenue and launch-related data.

### Predictive Modeling
- Classification models trained and evaluated to predict first-stage landing success.
